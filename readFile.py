# Define methods to read transaction and flag files
# @author Terada 26, June, 2011
# @editor aika 1, Nov. 2011
#    Developing the readValueFile for handling the value.
# @editor aika 10, Nov. 2011
#    Change readTransactionFile. If file has space the front and the end, remove them.
# @editor aika, 11, Mar. 2014
#    Change readFiles for keeping transaction ID.
